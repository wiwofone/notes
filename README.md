# Notes
Notes is a hobby project I develop to keep my React knowledge up-to-date as well
as delving in to Redux. I also try to incorporate state-of-the-art (or new)
tooling to get what the fuzz is all about. Basically, this project keeps my
JavaScript in shape when not doing professional development.  I've kept away
from boilerplate generators and instead tried to incorporate different tools and
technologies as the project grows (with varying success ðŸ˜‚).

## Tools used
* [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) with HMR for development and building
* [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) for next generation JS
* [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) with the AirBnB flavour to keep my code clean
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for my containers and components
  * ...and [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for route management
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for state management (with [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux))
* [Aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite) for styling components
* And also out-of-repo tools such as React and Redux DevTools

## Todo

- [] Add a real editor (perhaps MediumEditor?)
- [] Design components (for real)
- [] Authentication (Google OAuth?)
- [] Persist the state in something else than localStorage (after authentication obviously, Firebase maybe?)
- [] Testing

## Tools/technologies/concepts to check out:
* Server-side rendering
* Rollup
* Offline usage
* Internationalization
* Accessibility

## Check it out

1. Clone the repo
2. Run a `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` to start the Webpack dev server on [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080) with HMR enabled or `npm run build` to build the bundle with Webpack.
